## Multiple Database Support

Besides LeanClou which is used by default, Waline also supports a variety of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and MongoDB.

You only need to configure the environment variables of the corresponding database, and Waline will automatically switch to the corresponding data storage service according to the environment variables you configure.

See [multi-database support](../database.md) for details.

## Configuration

Most configurations on the server side can be configured through environment variables, and you can also configure some advanced options in the main entry file.

For configuration details, see [Server Reference → Environment Variables](../../reference/server/env.md) and [Server Reference → Configuration](../../reference/server/ config.md).
